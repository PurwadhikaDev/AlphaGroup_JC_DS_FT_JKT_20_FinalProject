Banking is a fundamental cornerstone of modern economies, offering a range of financial services to both individuals and businesses. One of the key challenges faced by banks worldwide is the ever-growing competition, not only from fellow traditional banks but also from newer fintech companies. To maintain a stable financial footing, it is essential for banks to increase their deposits, which can then be used to fund loans and other investments.

Banks provide an array of products, ranging from basic savings and checking accounts to complex financial instruments and loans. One specific product that is of particular interest, especially in this context, is the term deposit.

A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that allows customers to deposit their money for a specified period, ranging from a few months to several years. In return, they receive interest at a predetermined rate, which is often higher than standard savings accounts. At the end of the term, the customer receives their initial deposit along with the accrued interest. The advantage for the bank is that these deposits are often locked in for the term, providing the bank with stable funds.
